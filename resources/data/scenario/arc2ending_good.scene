You lie awake for a little while thinking about the story of Gwen. Something about it makes you wonder if it’s true.

You feel uneasy about the details but your eyes start to grow heavy and you fall asleep.

Zzzzzzz....

[bg img="black"]
You slowly wake up feeling quite groggy for some reason.

It’s very dark but it couldn’t possibly still be night. Your eyes take a while to adjust.

A dark figure is lit by the light in the doorway. You can’t make out who it is.

You call out to the figure and they seem to acknowledge you.

You can feel their stare pierce you. Could this be the same person who took Gwen?

The figure walks out of the door and begins to close the door slowly.

[sound param="giggle.mp3"]
A high pitched giggle comes from the figure’s mouth. 

You scream but the door is closed before you finish. You’ve become the figure’s latest victim.

[bg img="black"]
This is...the end...
