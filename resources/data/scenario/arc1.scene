[msg char="Narrator"]
This is a story that starts off much like this night, Kohaku's parents had gone away for the weekend. 

She decided to have some friends around for a slumber party.

Kohaku thought it would be a really fun idea to start telling ghost stories to each other.

As the night got later and later the stories became more and more scary.

As we started getting tired and ran out of stories to tell, they decided it was about time to go to bed when they heard a loud scream from outside.

About a minute of silence passed after the scream, Kohaku wasnt quite sure what to make of it when suddenly her phone rang.

[msg char="Toko"]
Dont answer that!

[msg char="Misaki"]
I'm scared, lets call the police.

[msg char="Narrator"]
Kohaku answered the phone and all she could heard was the gurgled sounds of someone drowning in their own blood.

The other girls had heard what she had heard, and thus begun a very serios conversation.

[msg char="Kohaku"]
I think we should go out and check out that scream.

[msg char="Misako"]
NO WAY! I am not leaving this house, we should call the police and let them deal with it.

[msg char="Toko"]
I'm really creeped out, I dont want to be left alone.

[msg char="Kohaku"]
What if there is someone out there in need of help! We need to go.

[msg char="Misako"]
You can go out there yourself, Toko and I are staying here.
