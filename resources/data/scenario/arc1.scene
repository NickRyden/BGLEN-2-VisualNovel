This is a story that starts off much like this night, my parents had gone away for the weekend. 

I decided to have some friends around for a slumber party.

I thought it would be a really fun idea to start telling ghost stories to each other.

As the night got later and later the stories became more and more scary.

As we started getting tired and ran out of stories to tell, we decided it was about time to go to bed when we heard a loud scream from outside.

About a minute of silence passed after the scream, I wasnt quite sure what to make of it when suddenly my phone rang.

[msg char="Toko"]
Dont answer that!

[msg char="Misaki"]
I'm scared, lets call the police.

[msg char="Narrator"]
I answered the phone and all I could heard was the gurgled sounds of someone drowning in their own blood.

The other girls had heard what I had heard, and thus begun a very serios conversation.

[msg char="Kohaku"]
I think we should go out and check out that scream.

[msg char="Misako"]
NO WAY! I am not leaving this house, we should call the police and let them deal with it.

[msg char="Toko"]
I'm really creeped out, I dont want to be left alone.

[msg char="Kohaku"]
What if there is someone out there in need of help! We need to go.

[msg char="Misako"]
You can go out there yourself, Toko and I are staying here.

[msg char="Narrator"]
And with that settled I left to go find the source of the screams.

I went out to check the park next to my house and found my neighbour bleeding and half concious.

Petrified that I could be next, I imediately called the police and stayed with my neighbour in the hope that the attacker didnt come back.

Once the police and ambulance arrived, I decided to go back to the house and check on the girls.

[msg char="Narrator"]
What I found left me scared for life.

My friends had been brutally murdered by the attacker while I was outside.

The police never found the attacker, they are still out there targeting girls at slumber parties.
