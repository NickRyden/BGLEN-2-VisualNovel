So this happened a couple years back at the old abadoned house on greenview road.
I dunno how long exactly but a family used to live there, moved out here from the city. I heard they were running from something in the city.
Not sure what but rumour was something or someone was after that family! Chased them out of the city.
Was the parents and their daughter Susan anyway they left not long after but I heard from a friend of a friend of a friend that 3 kids broke in to the old house wanting to use a ouji board cause of a dare.

Anyway The kids got in and as they were setting up the board.
One of them noticed something over in the corner. They found this old toy that no one saw on the way in. It had the name "Bella" printed on it.
Then as one of them went to pick up the doll…..
