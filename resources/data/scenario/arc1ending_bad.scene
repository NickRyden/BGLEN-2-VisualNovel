Kohaku went out to check the park next to her house and found her neighbour bleeding and half concious.

Petrified that she could be next, she imediately called the police and stayed with her neighbour in the hope that the attacker didnt come back.

Once the police and ambulance arrived, Kohaku decided to go back to the house and check on the girls.

Her friends had been brutally murdered by the attacker while she was outside.

The police never found the attacker, they are still out there targeting girls at slumber parties.
